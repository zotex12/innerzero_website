Most AI assistants treat their memory of you as a black box. You can sense that the system "knows" things, but you cannot open the lid, read the contents, or take a red pen to them. InnerZero is built the opposite way. Everything the assistant has learned about you is yours to inspect, correct, or erase. This guide walks through exactly how to do each of those things, and why keeping the memory local is what makes that control real rather than a setting on someone else's server.

## How do I see what InnerZero remembers about me?

Open the memory view inside InnerZero and you get a readable list of every fact the assistant has saved. These are written in plain language, not codes or hashes, so a memory might read like "prefers concise answers" or "works as a nurse on night shifts." You can scroll the whole list and read it top to bottom whenever you want.

The memory is not a hidden summary you have to guess at. It is the actual structured record the assistant draws on when it answers you. InnerZero builds this record gradually across sessions, picking up explicit facts you state, recurring topics you return to, and preferences you signal. If you have ever wondered what an assistant is quietly inferring about you, this is where you find out, in full, with no redactions.

Reading the list is also the fastest way to spot something wrong. Maybe the assistant noted a job title you held two roles ago, or recorded a one-off comment as a standing preference. Seeing it written down is the first step to fixing it, which the next section covers. For more on how this record is assembled in the first place, the piece on [how local AI memory works under the hood](/blog/ai-that-remembers) is the companion read to this one.

## Can I edit a single memory without deleting everything?

Yes. Each memory is an individual entry you can change on its own. Find the item in the memory view, correct the wording, and save it. The rest of the record stays exactly as it was. There is no need to wipe the whole history just to fix one wrong detail.

This matters because memories are not all equal. A wrong fact can quietly skew answers for weeks. If the assistant believes you live in one city when you moved last year, every location-aware suggestion drifts. Editing the single entry to the correct value puts the assistant back on track immediately, and the change takes effect the next time it pulls that fact into context.

Editing is also useful for refinement rather than correction. You might want to make a vague memory more precise, or soften one that the assistant has weighted too heavily. Because you are working with plain-language entries, you are effectively writing the note the way you want the assistant to read it. That is a level of authorship over your own profile that cloud assistants rarely hand you.

## How do I delete one thing the AI remembers?

Select the specific memory and remove it. The single entry disappears from the record and the assistant stops using it, while everything else you have built up stays intact. This is the tool for the moment you think "I never want it to bring that up again."

Targeted deletion is the right choice far more often than a full wipe. Say you discussed a sensitive personal situation that has since resolved, or you mentioned a project under NDA that should not linger in the assistant's working knowledge. Removing just those entries clears the sensitive material without throwing away the months of useful context the assistant has earned about how you like to work.

Deletion is final and local. When you remove an entry, it is gone from the database on your disk. There is no server-side copy held in reserve, no soft-delete shadow record sitting in a vendor's data warehouse waiting on a retention timer. What you delete is deleted, and the only place it ever lived was your own machine.

## How do I wipe everything InnerZero remembers?

Use the full memory reset to clear the entire record at once. This empties the local memory database and returns the assistant to a clean slate, as if you had just installed it. It is the right move when you are handing the machine to someone else, starting a genuinely fresh context, or you simply want everything gone.

A full wipe is deliberately a separate, clearly labelled action rather than something you can trigger by accident. After it runs, the assistant no longer knows your name, your preferences, or your history. It will start learning again from your next conversations, the same way it did on day one. Nothing carries over, because there is nothing left to carry.

Here is how the three operations compare so you can pick the right one for the situation.

| Action | What it affects | When to use it | Reversible |
|---|---|---|---|
| Edit a memory | One entry, reworded | A saved fact is wrong or imprecise | The old text is overwritten |
| Delete a memory | One entry, removed | One topic should never come up again | No, the entry is gone |
| Full memory reset | The entire record | Fresh start, or handing over the device | No, the database is cleared |

For most people, editing and single deletes are the everyday tools, and the full reset is the rare big-red-button option you reach for once in a while.

## Why does local storage put me fully in control?

Because the memory is a plain database file on your own drive, changing it does not depend on anyone else. There is no request to submit, no account dashboard with limited options, and no waiting on a company to honour a deletion. You open the app, you change the record, and it is changed. That is the whole transaction.

This is the structural difference between local and cloud memory. When an assistant stores your profile on its servers, you are asking the vendor to let you see and delete it, and you are trusting that "deleted" really means deleted across every backup and analytics pipeline they run. With InnerZero the data never left your machine to begin with, so there is no second copy to chase. The file lives in your user folder, protected by your operating system's disk encryption, BitLocker on Windows, FileVault on macOS, or LUKS on Linux. If you want to understand the storage model in full, the explainer on [where InnerZero keeps your data and how it stays private](/blog/how-innerzero-stays-private) goes deeper.

It is worth being precise about one thing. If you use InnerZero's optional cloud mode for a stronger model, only the current prompt and the context assembled for that single answer are sent to the provider. Your full memory database, your files, and your past conversations are never uploaded. So editing and deleting memories is genuinely a local act regardless of which model you point InnerZero at. This is one of the everyday benefits of running [a local AI assistant on your own hardware](/what-is-local-ai), where control over your data is the default rather than a feature you have to request.

## Frequently asked questions

### Does editing a memory in InnerZero affect past chat transcripts?

Editing a memory changes the structured fact the assistant carries forward, not the historical chat logs themselves. If you want to remove something from a past conversation as well, delete that conversation separately. The memory record and the chat history are distinct, so you can clean up one without disturbing the other.

### If I delete a memory, can InnerZero recover it later?

No. A deleted memory is removed from the local database and there is no hidden backup that the app restores from. The only way it could return is if you mention the same information again in a future conversation and the assistant saves it fresh. Deletion on your machine is final.

### Will a full memory reset uninstall InnerZero or remove my models?

No. A full memory reset only clears what the assistant remembers about you. The app itself, your installed local models, your settings, and any documents you have added stay in place. You keep a working assistant that has simply forgotten your personal context.

### Can I stop InnerZero from saving new memories at all?

The most reliable controls are the ones already in your hands: review the memory list, remove individual entries with single deletes, and run a full memory reset when you want a clean slate. Because the memory builds from your conversations, the simplest ongoing habit is to read the list now and then and delete anything you would rather it did not keep. The record never grows beyond what is on your own disk.

### Is my memory readable by anyone else on the same computer?

The memory is stored as a database file in your user profile, and it sits behind your operating system's disk encryption when that is enabled, such as BitLocker, FileVault, or LUKS. Anyone signed into your user account could open the app, so the same account hygiene you apply to email or documents applies here. The data is never exposed to InnerZero or to any third party.

### Do I need to be online to edit or delete what the AI remembers?

No. All memory management happens on your machine, so it works completely offline. You can view, edit, delete, or wipe the record with no internet connection, and nothing about the change is transmitted anywhere. The control is local end to end.
